# Skin-Cancer-Prediction

This project provides a simple web interface for predicting whether a skin lesion is malignant or benign using a pre-trained deep learning model. Users can upload an image containing a skin lesion, and the model will make a prediction based on the uploaded image.

## Getting Started

To run the web interface locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
   '''git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-cancer-prediction.git'''

2. Install the required dependencies:
   '''pip install -r requirements.txt'''

3. Run the Gradio interface script:
  '''python skin_cancer_prediction.py'''

4. Access the web interface in your browser at (https://94ceab7d82439da46a.gradio.live)

## Usage

1. Upload an image containing a skin lesion using the "Upload Image" button.
2. Click the "Predict" button to make a prediction.
3. The predicted result (Malignant or Benign) will be displayed on the screen.
